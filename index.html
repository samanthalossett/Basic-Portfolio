      <p>Hey there, the names Sam! I am new to coding, but loving every minute of it. Like a lot of people, I did not study coding while in college. I studied Psychology and Spanish and went on to a beautiful career in dental.</p>
     <p>The best parts of working in the dental field are the four day work weeks and the free toothbrushes! Other than that, it can feel like groundhogs day. This is what led me to coding! What I love about coding is the challenge, the creativity, and that awesome feeling you get when your code (FINALLY) works!</p>
